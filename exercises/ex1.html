            <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
            <p>We learned a couple new types of elements today. Let's put them to use.</p>
            <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
        </div>
        <div id="questions" class="container">
            <p id="q1">
                Given the text in the paragraph element with an id of a1, please insert line breaks at the end of each sentence.
            </p>
            <p id="q2">
                Given the text in the paragraph element with an id of a1, please insert a horizontal rule about halfway through
                the text. It doesn't have to be exact. Just eyeball it.
            </p>
            <p id="q3">
                Create an element inside of the div with an id of "a1" that contains the itsy bitsy spider with each 
                line of the nursery rhyme on its own line.
            </p>
            <p id="q4">Create a blockquote using a quote from W3Schools Module 2.</p>
            <p id="q5">Create a short quote using a quote from your favorite song in the element with an id of "a2".</p>
            <p id="q6">Create an abbreviation for HTML in the element with an id of "a3". Be sure to give it a title.</p>

            <!-- Note: You can complete the following exercises inside this div instead of the answers div-->
            <!-- For examples, please check W3Schools or the formatting section of the PowerPoint-->
            <p>Change the first three words of this element to bold</p>
            <p>Change the first three words of this element to be important text (strong).</p>
            <p>Change the last three words of this element to italics.</p>
            <p>Change this entire element to be emphassized.</p>
            <p>Mark this entire element.</p>
            <p>Shrink this text using a small element.</p>
            <p>"Delete" this text using a delete element.</p>
            <p>Underline this text using a insert element.</p>
            <p>Convert this text to subscript.</p>
            <p>Convert this text to superscript.</p>
            <p>Inside of the answers div, create an address element. Inside of the address, write your name on one line,
                and the address of your favorite restaurant on the next line.
            </p>
            <p>Inside of the element with an id of "a4", write the name of your favorite song, its artist, and the year it was
                written. Add the title to a cite element.
            </p>
            <p>Inside of the answers div, create a bi-directional override element. Copy the latin text from the element with
                an id of "a1" into it, then reverse the text so it prints backwards.
            </p>
            <p>Write a comment at the bottom of the answers div saying 'I am moving on to exercise 2'.</p>
